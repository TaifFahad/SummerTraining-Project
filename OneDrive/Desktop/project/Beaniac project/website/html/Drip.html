            <h1>Introduction:</h1>
            <p>
                Drip coffee, also known as filtered coffee, gets its name from the brewing process.
                Hot water is poured or dripped over ground coffee beans, allowing the water to extract flavors and
                oils as
                it passes through the coffee grounds and flows through a filter into a container.
                This straightforward and efficient brewing method is widely popular for producing a smooth and clean cup
                of coffee, making it a staple in households and coffee shops.
                Drip coffee is characterized by the passage of hot water through ground coffee beans.
                The infusion process in drip coffee extracts the coffee's flavor and caffeine, resulting in a<br>
                lighter yet distinct flavor profile compared to an Americano.
                Drip coffee typically uses light to medium roasts, contributing to a more acidic taste, with an average
                8-ounce cup containing about 95 mg of caffeine.
