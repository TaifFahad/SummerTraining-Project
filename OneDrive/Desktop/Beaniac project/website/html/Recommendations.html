      <h1>Robusta Coffee Beans</h1>
      <p>Grown in Africa, Vietnam, and Indonesia, robusta coffee beans differ significantly from Arabica beans in terms of flavor. Their flavor profile is deep and powerful, with occasional overtones of burnt rubber or woodiness. Their lower acidity levels give them a less sweet taste. Due to their ability to produce a layer of crema and have a rich flavor, Robusta beans are a popular choice for <span style = "background-color:rgb(106, 123, 113)">espresso and coffee blends</span>

        Compared to Arabica plants, which take several years to achieve maturity, robusta plants usually have a shorter fruit production cycle. In addition, robusta plants typically yield more crops per tree and show better resistance to pests and unfavorable weather.<br> 
        The cost of Robusta beans is comparatively cheaper than that of Arabica beans due to these considerations.Also, the caffeine concentration of Robusta beans is higher.

        Comparatively speaking to Arabica beans, Robusta beans are smaller and more rounded. They are usually lighter in color and have a less noticeable central crease</p>

    <section class="Arabica">
      <img src="/media/arabica.jpg"  alt="arabica coffee beans">
      <h1>Arabica Coffee Beans</h1>
      <p> Arabica beans are very well-liked and appreciated by many people who adore coffee. They feature a subtle flavor profile with a variety of flavors, such as flowery, fruity, and acidic undertones. Specialty coffees like <span style = "background-color:rgb(106, 123, 113)">brewed coffee</span> 

Arabica coffee beans are said to be among the first coffee species to be cultivated, and they have a long history. Usually oval in shape, they are bigger than Robusta beans and feature a noticeable center crease.

The bright and diverse flavors of Arabica beans are among the reasons that coffee lovers adore them. They typically have a softer, sweeter flavor with undertones of fruit, flowers, chocolate, and nuts. They do, however, have a greater acidity level.<br>
Arabica beans are typically more expensive than Robusta beans. Their more fragile nature and unique cultivation requirements are the main causes of this. It is noteworthy that Arabica beans contain less caffeine than Robusta beans.
Latin America is currently the world's greatest producer of Arabica coffee, with Brazil being a major source of these beans.

    <h2>What do you know about decaf coffee beans?</h2>
    <p>Since coffee beans inherently contain caffeine, there is no such thing as decaf coffee beans. Before roasting, they are decaffeinated by swelled with steam or water, and the caffeine is then extracted using water or an organic solvent. Ultimately, the decaf coffee beans undergo drying to restore their typical moisture content.

      Even though they are called "decaffeinated" decaf coffee beans never completely eliminate caffeine since it is impossible to do so.</p>
